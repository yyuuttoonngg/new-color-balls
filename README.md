Line up balls with the same color - vertical, horizontal or diagonal! 

To move, click the ball to select, then click an empty square. If there is a clear path, you can move it!

Balls can only move vertically or horizontally. Not Diagonally.

When your line up 5 or more balls of the same color, you score! (the random balls from the system don't count, sorry!)

Now try to stay alive!

Score:
5 balls - 10 points
6 balls - 12 points
7 balls - 18 points
8 balls - 28 points
9 balls - 42 points
